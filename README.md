## Disclaimer

This repository demonstrates how to build a logistic regression model to classify between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The solution provided is based on the **Coursera Project Network: [Diabetes Prediction With Pyspark MLLIB](https://www.coursera.org/learn/diabetes-prediction-with-pyspark-mllib)** project-based course on Coursera.

## Project Scenario

This project aims to predict diabetes using a Logistic Regression classifier built with PySpark MLlib.

## Objectives

* Perform ETL activity
* Build a Logistic Regression classifier
* Evaluate the model's performance
* Persist it for future use

## Datasets

For this project, we will use a modified version of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database (`diabetes.csv`), which is available in this [repository](https://github.com/pregismond/diabetes_dataset).

The original dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

This dataset contains data exclusively from female patients. It includes various symptoms of diabetes, such as age, blood pressure, BMI, insulin levels, glucose levels, etc. The dataset also has an output class label with two possible values: 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that the patient is non-diabetic, while a value of 1 indicates that the patient has diabetes. Please note that this dataset and the model we train in this project are for educational purposes only and cannot be used in real-life applications.
