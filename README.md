## Project Scenario



## Objectives

* Perform ETL activity
* Build a Logistic Regression classifier
* Evaluate the model's performance
* Persist it for future use

## Datasets

For this project, we will use a modified version of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database `diabetes.csv`, which is available in this repository.

The original dataset can be found here: 

The dataset contains data of female patients only. It contains some of the symptoms of diabetic patients like age, blood pressure, BMI, insulin, glucose, etc. and has got an output class label that has two values as either 0 or 1. The 0 resembles that a patient is non-diabetic and 1 resembles that a person has diabetes. Please note that this dataset, and the model that we train in the project, cannot be used in real life. We are only using this data for educational purposes.
